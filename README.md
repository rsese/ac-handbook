# Animal Crossing Handbook :notebook:

Simple web client on top of http://acnhapi.com/, just for fish, villagers, bugs, and fossils.  You can:

* browse lists of each type 🕵️‍♀️
* view individual fish, villagers, bugs, and fossils 🐟
* add comments on each individual fish, villagers, bugs, and fossils 💬

Made with:

* Node + Express for the server
* Handlebars templates
* Firebase to store comments

Fun things:

* Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript + Node to build something from scratch 🖥
* Building a web client for an API to make it easier to consume the API 📖
* Building some responsiveness into the site using media queries 🎨
* Extracting some of the logic out of the route handlers (started by just making API and database calls directly in the route handlers, moved to some model-y type separation) 🗿

Potential todos:

* Add some basic tests
* Add CI/CD with Actions
* Add authentication (for commenting, etc.)
